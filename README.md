# MAMI Public Targets List

The H2020 Measurement and Architecture for a Middleboxed Internet (MAMI)
Project Public Targets List (PTL) is a set of Internet hostnames, resolved
addresses, and information about the protocol(s) these hosts are known to
listen on, to provide a set of targets for active Internet measurements. The
PTL is derived from the published results of ongoing and prior active Internet
measurement studies, as well as freely available lists of public measurement
targets. MAMI uses this list to provide destination diversity for Internet
path transparency studies, but we intend this resource to be of general
utility to all active measurement studies of services in the Internet.
